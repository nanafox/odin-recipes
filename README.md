# Foundations Course Project: Recipes

This project is to test my understanding of the core components of HTML concepts.<br>
Though it might look very beautiful *yet*, it is a start to get my feet in the door and
make it better as I progress.

## Skills learned

By the end of this project, I will be more confident in the following HTML
concepts

- Elements and Tags
- Working with Texts
- Lists
  - Ordered
  - Unordered
- Links and images
- Writing good commit messages
